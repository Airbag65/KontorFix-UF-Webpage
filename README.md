# KontorFix-UF-Webpage
This is a website I made for our UF company, using HTML, CSS and JS.
A UF company is a Swedish thing that makes it possible for highschool students like myself to run and develop a small business.
I have for the sake of uploading it changed most of the text from Swedish to english and replaces the paragraphs with Lorem.
The page includes a startpage, two productpags to showcase our products in more depth, an about us page and an order page consisting of a form that the customer will fill out to place an order.
When the form is filled the customer will be asked to confirm the order and an orderconfirmation will be sent to the email they filled in.
An email will also be sent to our company adress with the information about the customer and the order.
